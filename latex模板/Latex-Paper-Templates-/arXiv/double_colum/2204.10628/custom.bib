We demonstrate that the generated contexts substantially enrich the semantics of the queries and GAR with sparse representations (BM25) achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods such as DPR. We show that generating diverse contexts for a query is beneficial as fusing their results consistently yields better retrieval accuracy. Moreover, as sparse and dense representations are often complementary, GAR can be easily combined with DPR to achieve even better performance. GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets under the extractive QA setup when equipped with an extractive reader, and consistently outperforms other retrieval methods when the same generative reader is used.",

abstract = {When experiencing an information need, users want to engage with a domain expert, but often turn to an information retrieval system, such as a search engine, instead. Classical information retrieval systems do not answer information needs directly, but instead provide references to (hopefully authoritative) answers. Successful question answering systems offer a limited corpus created on-demand by human experts, which is neither timely nor scalable. Pre-trained language models, by contrast, are capable of directly generating prose that may be responsive to an information need, but at present they are dilettantes rather than domain experts - they do not have a true understanding of the world, they are prone to hallucinating, and crucially they are incapable of justifying their utterances by referring to supporting documents in the corpus they were trained over. This paper examines how ideas from classical information retrieval and pre-trained language models can be synthesized and evolved into systems that truly deliver on the promise of domain expert advice.},

year = {2008},
isbn = {0387789081},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {1},
abstract = {The Burrows-Wheeler Transform is a text transformation scheme that has found applications in different aspects of the data explosion problem, from data compression to index structures and search. The BWT belongs to a new class of compression algorithms, distinguished by its ability to perform compression by sorted contexts. More recently, the BWT has also found various applications in addition to text data compression, such as in lossless and lossy image compression, tree-source identification, bioinformatics, machine translation, shape matching, and test data compression. This book will serve as a reference for seasoned professionals or researchers in the area, while providing a gentle introduction, making it accessible for senior undergraduate students or first year graduate students embarking upon research in compression, pattern matching, full text retrieval, compressed index structures, or other areas related to the BWT. Key Features Comprehensive resource for information related to different aspects of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform including: Gentle introduction to the BWT History of the development of the BWT Detailed theoretical analysis of algorithmic issues and performance limits Searching on BWT compressed data Hardware architectures for the BWT Explores non-traditional applications of the BWT in areas such as: Bioinformatics Joint source-channel coding Modern information retrieval Machine translation Test data compression for systems-on-chip Teaching materials ideal for classroom use on courses in: Data Compression and Source Coding Modern Information Retrieval Information Science Digital Libraries }

abstract = {We present a novel implementation of compressed suffix arrays exhibiting new tradeoffs between search time and space occupancy for a given text (or sequence) of n symbols over an alphabet σ, where each symbol is encoded by lg|σ| bits. We show that compressed suffix arrays use just nHh + σ bits, while retaining full text indexing functionalities, such as searching any pattern sequence of length m in O(m lg |σ| + polylog(n)) time. The term Hh ≤ lg |σ| denotes the hth-order empirical entropy of the text, which means that our index is nearly optimal in space apart from lower-order terms, achieving asymptotically the empirical entropy of the text (with a multiplicative constant 1). If the text is highly compressible so that Hn = o(1) and the alphabet size is small, we obtain a text index with o(m) search time that requires only o(n) bits. Further results and tradeoffs are reported in the paper.},

abstract = {We present parallel lightweight algorithms to construct wavelet trees, rank and select structures, and suffix arrays in a shared-memory setting. The work and depth of our first parallel wavelet tree algorithm match those of the best existing parallel algorithm while requiring asymptotically less memory and our second algorithm achieves the same asymptotic bounds for small alphabet sizes. Our experiments show that they are both faster and more memory-efficient than existing parallel algorithms. We also present an experimental evaluation of the parallel construction of rank and select structures, which are used in wavelet trees. Next, we design the first parallel suffix array algorithm based on induced copying. Our induced copying requires linear work and polylogarithmic depth for constant alphabets sizes. When combined with a parallel prefix doubling algorithm, it is more efficient in practice both in terms of running time and memory usage compared to existing parallel implementations. As an application, we combine our algorithms to build the FM-index in parallel.}
