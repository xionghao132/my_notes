With the development of retriever in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA), the performance of Question Answering (QA) is improved.In order to enhance the ability of Sparse Retriever, we propose a reranker model to rerank the retrieved passages.In this way, we can reduce the choice of wrong passages and predict the right orders of golden passages to get a better results.Compared with conversational methods, such as BM25, we conduct experiments on NQ dataset and Trivia dataset,and  improving the top-10 accuracy in retriever stage in 10 points, and 6 points accuracy improved in QA.
